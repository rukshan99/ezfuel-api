# Restful web services for ezFuel app

## Background
For several months, long queues formed for kilometers outside fuel stations around the country as Sri Lanka struggled to get enough fuel supply owing to a severe currency deficit in the midst of the worst economic crisis in the country's post-independence history.

## Solution
ezFuel is a mobile application with a community-driven approach to manage fuel queues in Sri Lanka efficiently by recording the details of fuel queues, remaining fuel amounts and making the details publicly available with live updates.
